      "What causes Heart Failure ? [/INST] Heart failure is caused by damage to the heart muscle, which makes it harder for the heart to pump blood. The heart muscle can become damaged due to a variety of factors, including:                  - Heart attack or coronary artery disease  - Heart valve problems  - Heart muscle disease  - Heart failure caused by other conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or a virus  - Heart failure caused by a congenital heart defect  - Heart failure caused by a heart transplant                  Heart failure can also be caused by a condition called cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy is a disease that affects the heart muscle. It can cause the heart to become enlarged, thin, or stiff.                  Heart failure can also be caused by a condition called pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the lungs. It can cause the heart to work harder to pump blood.                  Heart failure can also be caused by a condition called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This condition occurs when the heart muscle becomes stiff and can't relax. It can cause the heart to pump blood less effectively.                  Heart failure can also be caused by a condition called heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. This condition occurs when the heart muscle becomes weak and can't pump blood effectively.                  Heart failure can also be caused by a condition called atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heartbeat. It can cause the heart to beat too fast or too slow.                  Heart failure can also be caused by a condition called chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease is a condition in which the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. It can cause the heart to work harder to pump blood.                  Heart failure can also be caused by a condition called anemia. Anemia is a condition in which the body has too few red blood cells or not enough hemoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues.                  Heart failure can also be caused by a condition called thyroid disease. Thyroid disease is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormones\n"
